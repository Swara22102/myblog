    <h1>My Favourite Hobby</h1>
    <h1>Crafts</h1>
    <p>My favourite hobby is making crafts.This is my third favourite hobby.I have many favourite hobbies.I'm 13 years old and I'm in 7th grade.I really love making crafts.There are advantages and disadvantages in making crafts for me.The advantage is that I really work hard and I get a very beautiful piece of craft.The disadvantage is that my hands often get sticky because of glue and sometimes color.It really does'nt matter but still!Today I created a mobile aeroplane using colored and uncolored candysticks.It turned out very good but also my hand was glued too.I never care.I always care about the output I'm gonna get through it.There are more things I've created yet, and one of them was when I created a decorative diya-base using old cd's,glass colors and 3-d outliner.It turned out preety well but also useful.These are some reasons why I like crafts.
